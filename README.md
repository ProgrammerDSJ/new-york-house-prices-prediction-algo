# new-york-house-prices-prediction-algo
This machine learning algorithm helps the user find the estimated housing prices at New York.

This project has been divided into 3 stages:
1. The 4 feature prediction algorithm.
2. The 12 feature prediction algorithm.
3. The explicit block of code which will let the user find the estimated value by running the particular code block.
